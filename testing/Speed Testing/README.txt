===== ElectricStats API Speed Tester =====

This tool collects response time data of Electric Boogaloo's API and
Team Rocket's API.

===== Using the tester =====

To use the speed tester, simply execute the speed_test.py Python file.
Keep in the mind the script was written using python3.

The file can be executed by simply typing the following into a
terminal:

python3 speed_test.py <-e or -t>

The -e argument runs the test on Electric Boogaloo's API.
The -t argument runs the test on Team Rocket's API.

After the test is complete, the results of the test can be found in
the results.txt file.

While the test is running, once each phase of the test is complete, a
message will be printed to the terminal.
